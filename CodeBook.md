## Summary Data Set
This data is stored in the file "data/summary_data.txt" and in the data frame summary_data.

The data has the following columns:
- subject - id of the subject (int)
- label - the activity for the row (factor)

The following columns contain the mean, grouped by subject and label:
- time-body-acceleration-mean-y                          
- time-body-acceleration-mean-z
